This is a proof of concept in the development of an online bus registration system for a fictional school.  The Online Bus Registration system is an online based system that allows parents to register their students for the school’s bus transportation for the current year. The system provides a 
centralized, user-friendly interface for managing bus routes, learner registrations, approvals, and notifications, enhancing the overall efficiency of school transport administration.

on the school’s administration. 
Data Management: The system supports efficient data handling, providing schools with reliable storage and retrieval of registration details. 
Notifications: Automatic email notifications keep parents and administrators informed of registration status and updates. 
Enhanced Security: Incorporates user authentication and secure data transmission to safeguard access to sensitive information.
